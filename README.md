Install and enable remi yum repositories on your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/playbook.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.remi
      remi_enabled_repositories:
        - php73
```

The machine you are running this on, may need to be prepared, I use this playbook to ensure everything is in place to let the role work.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap
    - robertdebock.epel
```
